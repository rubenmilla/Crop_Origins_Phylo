This is a readme file of the live (regularly updated) version of the Crop Origins database.
Crop Origins is curated by Rubén Milla (ruben.milla@gmail.com), and is deposited and updated in github: https://github.com/rubenmilla/Crop_Origins_Phylo .
This database includes a comprehensive ckecklist of crops species cultivated for food, and data on diverse continuous and categorical descriptors of antiquity of cultivation, organ harvested for primary use, growth form, agricultural relevance, and identities, distribution and climate at origin of crops´ wild progenitors. 
The database is composed of four files:
The current readme file (readme_ crop_origins_live.txt);
a metadata file with a key of column headers (metadata_ crop_origins_live.txt); 
a file with the literature sources used to get data on the identity of wild progenitors of crops, cultivation antiquity, and type of use. The file is in BiBteX format, and the label of each reference links with the lists of sources in the database (sources_ crop_origins_live.txt); 
the database itself (crop_origins_live_db.csv).
