abstract = {Recent excavations at Aksum, Ethiopia, have produced a substantial assemblage of charred plant macrofossils and charcoal. While the analysis is still at a preliminary stage, it has been possible to establish that both Near Eastern and African crops were grown in the Aksum area from at least 500 BC. The range of crops in the pre-Aksumite period is limited to wheat, barley, flax and tef; by the mid to late Aksumite period a further 12 species are evident, again of both Near Eastern and African origin. The new cultigens are potential cash crops (oil and fiber plants, fruits and vegetables), which often typify the move towards a market economy. The results imply that the traditional system of dryland plow agriculture (based on the ox and mixed annual crops) was in existence by at least the mid 1st millennium BC.},

abstract = {Summary Some of the World's most valuable crops, including watermelon, honey melon, cucumber, squash, zucchini and pumpkin, belong to the family Cucurbitaceae. We review insights on their domestication from new phylogenies, archaeology and genomic studies. Ancestral state estimation on the most complete Cucurbitaceae phylogeny to date suggests that an annual life cycle may have contributed to domestication. Domestication started c. 11 000 years ago in the New World and Asia, and apparently more recently in Africa. Some cucurbit crops were domesticated only once, others multiple times (e.g. melon from different Asian and African populations). Most wild cucurbit fruits are bitter and nonpalatable to humans, and nonbitterness of the pulp apparently was a trait favoured early during domestication, with genomic data showing how bitterness loss was achieved convergently. The genetic pathways underlying lycopene accumulation, red or orange pulp colour, and fruit size and shape are only just beginning to be understood. The study of cucurbit domestication in recent years has benefitted from the increasing integration of archaeological and genomic data with insights from herbarium collections, the most efficient way to understand species? natural geographic ranges and climate adaptations.},

A comprehensive model of apple speciation and domestication along the Silk Road is proposed based on evidence from diverse genomic analyses. Cultivated apples likely originate from Malus sieversii in Kazakhstan, followed by intensive introgressions from M. sylvestris. M. sieversii in Xinjiang of China turns out to be an “ancient” isolated ecotype not directly contributing to apple domestication. We have identified selective sweeps underlying quantitative trait loci/genes of important fruit quality traits including fruit texture and flavor, and provide evidences supporting a model of apple fruit size evolution comprising two major events with one occurring prior to domestication and the other during domestication. This study outlines the genetic basis of apple domestication and evolution, and provides valuable information for facilitating marker-assisted breeding and apple improvement.},

@article{54,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Archaeobotany, the study of plant remains from sites of ancient human activity, provides data for studying the initial evolution of domesticated plants. An important background to this is defining the domestication syndrome, those traits by which domesticated plants differ from wild relatives. These traits include features that have been selected under the conditions of cultivation. From archaeological remains the easiest traits to study are seed size and in cereal crops the loss of natural seed dispersal. SCOPE: The rate at which these features evolved and the ordering in which they evolved can now be documented for a few crops of Asia and Africa. This paper explores this in einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) from the Near East, rice (Oryza sativa) from China, mung (Vigna radiata) and urd (Vigna mungo) beans from India, and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) from west Africa. Brief reference is made to similar data on lentils (Lens culinaris), peas (Pisum sativum), soybean (Glycine max) and adzuki bean (Vigna angularis). Available quantitative data from archaeological finds are compiled to explore changes with domestication. The disjunction in cereals between seed size increase and dispersal is explored, and rates at which these features evolved are estimated from archaeobotanical data. Contrasts between crops, especially between cereals and pulses, are examined. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that in domesticated grasses, changes in grain size and shape evolved prior to non-shattering ears or panicles. Initial grain size increases may have evolved during the first centuries of cultivation, within perhaps 500-1000 years. Non-shattering infructescences were much slower, becoming fixed about 1000-2000 years later. This suggests a need to reconsider the role of sickle harvesting in domestication. Pulses, by contrast, do not show evidence for seed size increase in relation to the earliest cultivation, and seed size increase may be delayed by 2000-4000 years. This implies that conditions that were sufficient to select for larger seed size in Poaceae were not sufficient in Fabaceae. It is proposed that animal-drawn ploughs (or ards) provided the selection pressure for larger seeds in legumes. This implies different thresholds of selective pressure, for example in relation to differing seed ontogenetics and underlying genetic architecture in these families. Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) may show some similarities to the pulses in terms of a lag-time before truly larger-grained forms evolved.},

@article{159,
abstract = {Worldwide, potato is the third most important crop grown for direct human consumption, but breeders have struggled to produce new varieties that outperform those released over a century ago, as evidenced by the most widely grown North American cultivar (Russet Burbank) released in 1876. Despite its importance, potato genetic diversity at the whole-genome level remains largely unexplored. Analysis of cultivated potato and its wild relatives using modern genomics approaches can provide insight into the genomic diversity of extant germplasm, reveal historic introgressions and hybridization events, and identify genes targeted during domestication that control variance for agricultural traits, all critical information to address food security in 21st century agriculture.Cultivated potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.), domesticated from wild Solanum species native to the Andes of southern Peru, possess a diverse gene pool representing more than 100 tuber-bearing relatives (Solanum section Petota). A diversity panel of wild species, landraces, and cultivars was sequenced to assess genetic variation within tuber-bearing Solanum and the impact of domestication on genome diversity and identify key loci selected for cultivation in North and South America. Sequence diversity of diploid and tetraploid S. tuberosum exceeded any crop resequencing study to date, in part due to expanded wild introgressions following polyploidy that captured alleles outside of their geographic origin. We identified 2,622 genes as under selection, with only 14–16{\%} shared by North American and Andean cultivars, showing that a limited gene set drove early improvement of cultivated potato, while adaptation of upland (S. tuberosum group Andigena) and lowland (S. tuberosum groups Chilotanum and Tuberosum) populations targeted distinct loci. Signatures of selection were uncovered in genes controlling carbohydrate metabolism, glycoalkaloid biosynthesis, the shikimate pathway, the cell cycle, and circadian rhythm. Reduced sexual fertility that accompanied the shift to asexual reproduction in cultivars was reflected by signatures of selection in genes regulating pollen development/gametogenesis. Exploration of haplotype diversity at potato's maturity locus (StCDF1) revealed introgression of truncated alleles from wild species, particularly S. microdontum in long-day–adapted cultivars. This study uncovers a historic role of wild Solanum species in the diversification of long-day–adapted tetraploid potatoes, showing that extant natural populations represent an essential source of untapped adaptive potential.},

Chloroplast DNA is a very reliable indicator to trace maternal ancestry of crops. Most of the common potato (grown worldwide) has unique, T-type chloroplast DNA derived from Chilean cultivated potato (both areS. tuberosum ssp.tuberosum). Analyzing seven different chloroplast DNA markers, I found all the T-type accessions of cultivated potatoes shared the same chloroplast DNA haplotype only with some accessions ofS. tarijense Hawkes and its derived hybrids. Thus, I conclude that some populations ofS. tarijense acted as the maternal ancestor of potato.},

abstract = {Domesticated food crops are derived from a phylogenetically diverse assemblage of wild ancestors through artificial selection for different traits. Our understanding of domestication, however, is based upon a subset of well-studied 'model' crops, many of them from the Poaceae family. Here, we investigate domestication traits and theories using a broader range of crops. We reviewed domestication information (e.g. center of domestication, plant traits, wild ancestors, domestication dates, domestication traits, early and current uses) for 203 major and minor food crops. Compiled data were used to test classic and contemporary theories in crop domestication. Many typical features of domestication associated with model crops, including changes in ploidy level, loss of shattering, multiple origins, and domestication outside the native range, are less common within this broader dataset. In addition, there are strong spatial and temporal trends in our dataset. The overall time required to domesticate a species has decreased since the earliest domestication events. The frequencies of some domestication syndrome traits (e.g. nonshattering) have decreased over time, while others (e.g. changes to secondary metabolites) have increased. We discuss the influences of the ecological, evolutionary, cultural and technological factors that make domestication a dynamic and ongoing process.},

abstract = {Chaya (Cnidoscolus aconitifolius) (Mill.) I.M. Johnst is a neglected and underutilized crop, cultivated clonally by the Maya from pre-Hispanic times to the present in their home gardens for their own consumption. Like other crops in the early stages of domestication, cultivated chaya co-occurs with its wild relatives, however, the degree of domestication of chaya is unclear. Wild and cultivated chaya exhibit some morphological differences, however, no study has assessed quantitatively the degree of divergence between these varieties. The main objective of this study was to assess the domestication degree of chaya, by measuring morphological divergence in vegetative traits (leaf number, area, toughness, trichome number, as well as plant size, number of branches and trunk width) in wild and cultivated plants. Our results show that cultivated and wild plants had only a minor degree of overlap in the multivariate morphological space. The cultivated variety had more branches and leaves, and their leaves were softer and had fewer trichomes than the wild variety. This divergence is probably reinforced by the fact that desirable traits (number of branches and leaves) are negatively correlated with undesired traits (number of trichomes and toughness). Despite significant divergences between the two varieties, a few cultivated plants fell within phenotypic range of variation for wild plants, which could be due to recent artificial selection.},

Together, these have provided a better understanding of the selective pressures that accompany crop domestication, and they demonstrate that a synthesis from the twin vantage points of genetics and archaeology can expand our understanding of the nature of evolutionary selection that accompanies domestication.},

abstract = {Abstract Demographic modelling is often used with population genomic data to infer the relationships and ages among populations. However, relatively few analyses are able to validate these inferences with independent data. Here, we leverage written records that describe distinct Brassica rapa crops to corroborate demographic models of domestication. Brassica rapa crops are renowned for their outstanding morphological diversity, but the relationships and order of domestication remain unclear. We generated genomewide SNPs from 126 accessions collected globally using high-throughput transcriptome data. Analyses of more than 31,000 SNPs across the B. rapa genome revealed evidence for five distinct genetic groups and supported a European?Central Asian origin of B. rapa crops. Our results supported the traditionally recognized South Asian and East Asian B. rapa groups with evidence that pak choi, Chinese cabbage and yellow sarson are likely monophyletic groups. In contrast, the oil-type B. rapa subsp. oleifera and brown sarson were polyphyletic. We also found no evidence to support the contention that rapini is the wild type or the earliest domesticated subspecies of B. rapa. Demographic analyses suggested that B. rapa was introduced to Asia 2,400?4,100 years ago, and that Chinese cabbage originated 1,200?2,100 years ago via admixture of pak choi and European?Central Asian B. rapa. We also inferred significantly different levels of founder effect among the B. rapa subspecies. Written records from antiquity that document these crops are consistent with these inferences. The concordance between our age estimates of domestication events with historical records provides unique support for our demographic inferences.},

abstract = {The apple (Malus domestica [Suckow] Borkh.) is one of the most economically and culturally significant fruits in the world today, and it is grown in all temperate zones. With over a thousand landraces recognized, the modern apple provides a unique case study for understanding plant evolution under human cultivation. Recent genomic and archaeobotanical studies have illuminated parts of the process of domestication in the Rosaceae family. Interestingly, these data seem to suggest that rosaceous arboreal crops did not follow the same pathway toward domestication as other domesticated, especially annual, plants. Unlike in cereal crops, tree domestication appears to have been rapid and driven by hybridization. Apple domestication also calls into question the concept of centers of domestication and human intentionality. Studies of arboreal domestication also illustrate the importance of fully understanding the seed dispersal processes in the wild progenitors when studying crop origins. Large fruits in Rosaceae evolved as a seed-dispersal adaptation recruiting megafaunal mammals of the late Miocene. Genetic studies illustrate that the increase in fruit size and changes in morphology during evolution in the wild resulted from hybridization events and were selected for by large seed dispersers. Humans over the past three millennia have fixed larger-fruiting hybrids through grafting and cloning. Ultimately, the process of evolution under human cultivation parallels the natural evolution of larger fruits in the clade as an adaptive strategy, which resulted in mutualism with large mammalian seed dispersers (disperser recruitment).},

abstract = {Solanum stenotomum Juz. et Buk. (2n = 2x = 24) is considered to be the most primitive diploid cultivated species from which all the other Andean cultivated potatoes were originated (Hawkes 1990). To disclose chloroplast DNA (ctDNA) variability and the maternal origin of S. stenotomum, 36 accessions of S. stenotomum and 86 accessions of putative wild ancestral species were determined for ctDNA types and analyzed by high-resolution markers (seven ctDNA microsatellites and an H3 marker). High-resolution markers discriminated 57 different ctDNAs (haplotypes), which were classified into the W-type ctDNA group and C-, S- and A-type ctDNA group, and within the latter group S- and A-type ctDNAs were distinct from each other among many different haplotypes mostly having C-type ctDNA. This ctDNA relationship supported our previous findings obtained for mostly Andean cultivated species (Sukhotu et al. 2004). Compared with other putative ancestral wild species, S. stenotomum showed somewhat limited ctDNA diversity, having two major haplotypes 1 and 2 also found in different wild species in different places. Therefore, the ctDNA in S. stenotomum was of at least dual origins either by successive domestication from different species or else by introgression after initial S. stenotomum arose.},

abstract = {The domestication of crops is among the most important innovations in human history. Here, we test the hypothesis that cultivation and artificial selection for increased productivity of crops reduced plant defenses against herbivores. We compared the performance of two economically important generalist herbivores - the leaf-chewing beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) and the phloem-feeding green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) - across 29 crop species and their closely related wild relatives. We also measured putative morphological and chemical defensive traits and correlated them with herbivore performance. We show that, on average, domestication significantly reduced resistance to S. exigua, but not M. persicae, and that most independent domestication events did not cause differences in resistance to either herbivore. In addition, we found that multiple plant traits predicted resistance to S. exigua and M. persicae, and that domestication frequently altered the strength and direction of correlations between these traits and herbivore performance. Our results show that domestication can alter plant defenses, but does not cause strong allocation tradeoffs as predicted by plant defense theory. These results have important implications for understanding the evolutionary ecology of species interactions and for the search for potential resistance traits to be targeted in crop breeding.},

abstract = {Teosinte, the closest wild relative of maize with the largest population, covering over a thousand square kilometers in the 1960's, and the most wild of all the annual diploid forms is now suddenly (2004-5) frag- mented by changing land use. Due to the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) U.S. grown corn has en- tered Mexico and radically lowered the price of corn making it an unprofitable crop for a million small land- holders. Over a period of three years, hillside farmers of the Balsas have abandoned maize as a crop. The land is now fallow, grazed by livestock and teosinte is in immi- nent danger of extinction. Only barbed wire enclosed in situ conservation can preserve a population large enough to maintain the genes of wild teosinte. It will take active support of the idea of in situ conservation utilizing in- digenous cultivators if we are to capture the gene pool of wild teosinte and the genetic melting pot of introduced genes from the wild relatives into maize. If the maize breeding community does nothing, these natural reflux hybridization systems of teosinte and maize will become totally extinct before the end of the decade and we will never know exactly how they worked in the origin of maize. The only tools we will be left with are the seed samples in the germplasm banks of CIMMYT and Fort Collins. How is it best to know an antique - as the pre- served real thing or as a photograph?},
