This is a readme file of the Phylo Food v 1.0. phylogenetic tree (phylo_food_1_0.tre).
Phylo Food is a phylogenetic tree of the species in Crop Origins database. 
The tree is fully resolved, although 4 taxa (Xanthosoma caracu, Rubus brasiliensis, Pouteria sapota and P. procera) were artificially bound as basal to their genera, 
because no source of data or literature for topologically solving their phylogenetic placement further was found (see phylo_food_live_code.txt file).
Phylo Food is curated by Rubén Milla (ruben.milla@gmail.com), and is deposited and updated in github: https://github.com/rubenmilla/Crop_Origins_Phylo .

Additionally, a non-fully resolved phylogenetic tree of 74736 species of vascular plants, including the 866 species of crops, is provided (phylo_GBOTB_with_crops.tre).

This folder contains five files:
A readme file (readme_ phylo_food_1_0.txt);
The R code used to build the tree (phylo_food_1_0_code.txt); 
the literature sources cited in the code and used to resolve the tree, in BibTeX format (sources_used_to_resolve_phylo_food_1_0.txt); 
the time-calibrated and fully resolved phylogenetic tree of crop species (phylo_food_1_0.tre);
the non-fully resolved phylogenetic tree of vascular plants, including the 866 species of crops (phylo_GBOTB_with_crops.tre).
