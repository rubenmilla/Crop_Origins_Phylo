Crop_Origins_Phylo

This is the repository of the "Crop Origins" database and of the "Phylo Food" phylogenetic tree, as described in Milla (2019).

Crop Origins is a comprehensive ckecklist of crops species cultivated for food. It includes associated data on diverse continuous and categorical descriptors of antiquity of cultivation, organ harvested for primary use, growth form, and identities, distribution and climate at sites of origin of crops´ wild progenitors.

Phylo Food is a time-calibrated and fully resolved phylogenetic tree of the species in Crop Origins.

This repository includes a folder with version 1.0 of "Crop Origins" and "Phylo Food" (Crop_Origins_Phylo_v1_0), which is a static mirror of the supplementary material in Milla (2019); and a folder of a live version of both resources (Crop_Origins_Phylo_v_live), meant to be regularly updated. In those folders you can find the resources, plus readme and metadata files.
