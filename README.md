**Crop Origins** is a comprehensive ckecklist of crop species cultivated for food. It includes species-level data on diverse continuous and categorical descriptors of antiquity of cultivation, organ harvested for primary use, growth form, and identities, distribution and climate at sites of origin of crops´ wild progenitors.

**Phylo Food** is a time-calibrated and fully resolved phylogenetic tree of the species in Crop Origins.
